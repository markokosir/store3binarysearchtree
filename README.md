## Store 3 - Binary Search Tree

Three different data structures written from scratch. Store 3 is implemented using binary search tree. When the program starts it allocates memory for 4 products on heap. Since this version is implemented using binary  search tree, therefore it is possible to allocate memory during runtime. To keep things simple I decided to sort products by a code value, so when displaying products on the screen, they will be printed out in an increasing order.

Files included:
* products.txt - sample database
* codes.txt - codes for products
* main.h & main.c - heart of a program
* product.h & product.c - general functions for working with products
* file.h & file.c - functions for working with files
* utils.h & utils.c - utilities functions

Note: All the code is written in pure C programming language, however header file conio.h is inlcuded in this program(windows.h is also included for rendering reasons), which is not part of ANSI C standard.

Tested/Compiled - Windows XP/Microsoft Visual Studio 2005
